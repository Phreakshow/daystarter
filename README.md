# DayStarter

Daystarter is a project i created when I first started learning React. The point is to have a simple app, allowing me do set up some ToDo tasks at the start of the day, check the weather, set up a mood for the day and integrate Spotify - allowing Spotify to recommend tracks based on my current mood and the weather outside.

## Installation

To start the authentication server navigate to daystarter/src/components/SpotifyWidget/server/ and run:

```npm
npm run devStart
```
to start the app - navigate to /daystarter and run:
```npm
npm start
```

## Roadmap

For now the project is finished, but in the future i might come back to it to:

1. Do some design changes.
2. Implement a better Spotify suggestion algorithm.
3. Add new features.
4. Hook it to a database and launch on the web.
